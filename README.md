## Why StackForge?

Most AI tools are wrappers around a single model. StackForge is different — you design the **reasoning chain**:

1. **Pick your models** — GPT-5, Gemini Pro, open-source SLMs
2. **Set guardrails** — tone, task boundaries, output format, constraints
3. **Wire nodes into stacks** — multi-agent pipelines with routing, evaluation, and memory
4. **Deploy anywhere** — web, Android, edge devices, or self-hosted

## Core Features

### 🧠 AI Module Builder
Create configurable AI agents with system prompts, guardrails, task boundaries, and model selection. 12 module types: specialist · SLM · router · evaluator · critic · comparator · formatter · extractor · classifier · memory-filter · human-gate · synthesizer.

### 🔗 Stack Canvas
Visual multi-agent pipeline editor. Connect modules with conditional edges, parallel branches, and data routing.

### 🎨 Image Forge
Multi-perspective creative studio applying Cognitive Dense Perspective Training (CDPT) to image generation. Council Mode for AI-enriched prompts, Free Mode for interactive visual chatrooms.

### 🚀 Projects & Deploy
Full project lifecycle — web apps, Android apps, AI modules, stacks, and hybrids. AI-powered prompt interface with streaming progress and persistent chat history. One-click Android deployment pipeline.

### 🧪 Lab & Slicer Lab
Interactive testing environment. Run test cases, inspect step-by-step execution, compare outputs across module configurations.

### 🏪 Marketplace
Publish and discover community-built templates. Buy and sell modules, stacks, and project templates using credits.

### 📦 Export Studio
Export to Unity, Unreal Engine, ROS 2, Arduino, and Python with auto-generated, domain-specific code.

### 📡 Edge & On-Device
SLM mode for local model execution. On-device templates, edge training, and inference playground for running models directly on phones.

### 📄 White Paper Engine
Live-streaming academic documentation engine for "Curiosity-Driven Perspective Training" — the methodology behind StackForge's multi-perspective AI approach.

### Database (20 tables, all RLS-protected)

`projects` · `modules` · `stacks` · `runs` · `profiles` · `user_credits` · `credit_transactions` · `marketplace_templates` · `template_purchases` · `discussions` · `project_messages` · `training_datasets` · `dataset_samples` · `training_jobs` · `founder_interviews` · `cognitive_fingerprints` · `perspective_jobs` · `deploy_pipeline_status` · `mobile_captures` · `referrals` · `referral_earnings` · `user_api_keys`

## Credit Economy

| Tier | Monthly Credits | Price |
|------|----------------|-------|
| Free | 50 | $0 |
| Builder | 500 | $29/mo |
| Pro | 2,000 | $79/mo |

**Top-up packs**: 100 credits ($4.99) · 500 credits ($19.99) · 1,500 credits ($59.99)

Credits are consumed per AI run — costs vary by model from 1 credit (Gemini Flash Lite) to 10 credits (GPT-5.2).

---

## Security

- **Row Level Security** on every table — users only see their own data
- **Server-side credit mutations** — no client-side balance writes
- **Stripe webhook verification** for all payment fulfillment
- **SECURITY DEFINER** functions for safe cross-table operations
- **Tier-protected routes** enforced both client-side and server-side
